        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> I know, I know, it's February and its waaaay past the happy new years-wishing-period- but it’s my first blog post of the year so I still have the leeway to do that.
            Whew! It really has been a long break. I had my bar exams, then I traveled for the better part of December and January, and for this past week, I've just been trying
            to get back into things. Now I'm definitely well-rested and ready to knock out this year! And I thought, why not start it off with one of my favorite easy recipes.    
            So here we go with an amazing chicken pilau recipe, where we make our own pilau masala mix. I also have another Kenyan beef pilau recipe up on my YouTube channel and blog.
            Please check it out to have 2 recipes up your sleeve!

                <li>1/2 kg chicken in-bone</li>
                <li>3-4 medium-sized onions</li>
                <li>5 cloves of garlic.</li>
                <li>1/2 tablespoon of fresh ginger</li>
                <li>2 cups of rice.</li>
                <li>4 cups of water</li>
                <li>5 small potatoes.</li>
                <li>Fresh cinnamon</li>
                <li>Bay leaves</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of Pilau masala mix</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by frying the chopped onions in the vegetable oil until the onions are soft and almost browned.</li>
            <li>Add in the ginger and garlic paste and let this cook for 2 minutes until they’re fragrant.</li>
            <li>In my video recipe, I used fresh cinnamon, cardamoms and cumin. I added them right after ginger and garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken, season generously with salt, and cover.</li>
            <li>Allow the meat to cook until it dries up. The meat with let out its own juices and cook in them, and it will eventually dry out and begin to brown.</li>
            <li>Once the meat browns and caramelizes, add in the potatoes. Mix them together and let the potatoes sit in the oil and onion mix for a minute.</li>
            <li>After, add in the 3 tablespoons of Pilau masala mix and bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Let the spices toast for a minute to let them bring out their best flavors.</li>
            <li>Add in the washed rice and stir the rice into the spices until the rice gets mixed into the spices.</li>
            <li>Finally, add in the 4 cups of water and let this begin to boil while stirring to make sure everything is well mixed.</li>
            <li>Once it begins boiling, cover the sufuria with foil tightly and reduce the heat to the lowest heat.</li>
            <li>The rice will simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes until it dries out.</li>
            <li>Quick tip: Listen to the rice closely after the 10 minute mark. Literally listen for the crackling sound at the bottom of the sufuria to determine if the rice is dry.</li>
            <li>As much as following a recipe to the letter is great and well advised, learn to use your different senses in the kitchen because times may vary. Depending on the type of rice, amount of heat, amount of rice and type of sufuria, the cooking time may vary.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is dry, remove the foil and fluff the rice using a fork. Remove and discard the bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Use the fork to mix up the rice with any of the beef and onions that might have floated and settled at the top.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with some fresh kachumbari(salsa) and of course, a banana to go along with the spicy rice!</li>
